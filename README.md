Michael Capozello Java Calculator 
===============

For my personal project I wanted to do something in Java since my team and I have been learning it in order to complete our capstone project. With the help of a video tutorial I was able to create a working simple Java calculator application using Eclipse. The project src folder contains two classes the calculator_main class where the calculator was initialized and the calculator_ui class where all the code for the calculator was written.
